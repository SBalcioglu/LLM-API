The moviesRaw schema defines a graph structure tailored for a database modeling the film industry, encapsulating movies, people, and their myriad interactions. It comprises two node types: "Movie" and "Person." The "Movie" node carries attributes such as a "tagline" (the movie's slogan), "title" (the movie's name), "released" (the release year), and "votes" (the count of received ratings). The "Person" node includes "born" (the person's birth year) and "name" (the person's name). Several edges depict the nodes' relationships: "ACTED_IN" links a person to a movie and includes "roles" attributes, defining the characters played; "REVIEWED" connects a person to a movie with attributes like "summary" of the review and a "rating"; "PRODUCED" indicates a person's production role without additional attributes; "WROTE" shows a person as the movie's writer; "FOLLOWS" represents a social or hierarchical connection between two people; and "DIRECTED" marks the directorship of a person over a movie. This schema intricately maps out the film industry's network, detailing the professional interactions and relationships between individuals and cinematic works.
