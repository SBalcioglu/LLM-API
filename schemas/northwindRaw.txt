The northwindSchemaRaw defines a comprehensive graph structure tailored for a database that models a retail or wholesale business scenario, focusing on the interactions between orders, products, customers, suppliers, and product categories. It encompasses nodes that represent these entities, each with specific attributes, and edges that illustrate the relationships among them. The schema includes four node types: Order, Category, Customer, Product, and Supplier. The Order node contains attributes like customerID, shipCity, orderID, freight, requiredDate, employeeID, shipName, shipPostalCode, orderDate, shipRegion, shipCountry, shippedDate, shipVia, and shipAddress, detailing the order's specifics and shipping information. The Category node holds categoryID, description, categoryName, and picture attributes, categorizing products and providing essential details about each category. The Customer node is described with attributes such as country, address, contactTitle, city, phone, contactName, postalCode, companyName, fax, region, and customerID, offering a comprehensive profile on each customer, including their location and contact information. The Product node features a blend of attributes like reorderLevel, unitsInStock, unitPrice, supplierID, productID, discontinued, quantityPerUnit, categoryID, unitsOnOrder, and productName, which give insights into stock levels, pricing, and product details. Lastly, the Supplier node includes attributes such as supplierID, country, address, contactTitle, city, phone, contactName, postalCode, companyName, fax, region, and homePage, providing extensive information about the suppliers. The edges in the schema define the interconnections between these nodes: ORDERS linking Order to Product with attributes like unitPrice, productID, orderID, discount, and quantity that detail the ordered products; PART_OF connecting Product to Category, indicating product categorization without specific attributes; SUPPLIES associating Supplier with Product, signifying the supply chain relationships; and PURCHASED connecting Customer to Order, delineating which orders are made by which customers, without detailed attributes. Itâ€™s pivotal for mapping out the business's operational aspects, like inventory management, customer order tracking, and supplier relationships, providing a structured and relational view of the business data crucial for decision-making and strategic planning.
